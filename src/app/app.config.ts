/**
 * Seven providers, in the order spa-home documents and every sibling explorer repeats.
 *
 * - `provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners` funnels genuinely-global errors and unhandled rejections
 *   into Angular's `ErrorHandler`.
 * - `provideRouter` carries this app's state: every level of it is a path segment, so each screen
 *   is bookmarkable and the back button works with no code.
 * - `withFetch` is not a preference. The default XHR backend is invisible to OTLP fetch
 *   instrumentation, so choosing it would quietly forfeit client spans the moment this deployment
 *   grows a telemetry relay. Every call this app makes is a same-origin path behind the edge, and
 *   none of them is anonymous: the edge's session is what authenticates them, and it does so with
 *   cookies a same-origin request sends by default.
 * - `provideQitsNavigation` gives `QitsMainLayout` its left navigation, by asking the gateway for
 *   `/main-navigation` once at startup. The list is the gateway's answer — derived from the routes
 *   it actually serves — not a list compiled into @qits/ui-components; without this provider the
 *   chrome renders no links at all. It needs the `provideHttpClient` above.
 * - `provideQitsProjects` puts the project picker in the chrome's top-left slot, where the wordmark
 *   was, from one `GET /projects/api/projects`. Every resource on this platform belongs to a
 *   project, so which one is open is the outermost fact about a page rather than a filter inside
 *   one of them — above the links, because it scopes them. It also installs the repositories of
 *   whatever project is in scope, which the sidebar draws under each category.
 * - `provideQitsScope('repository')` says how deep this application's own addresses go. An
 *   application's configuration is a repository's, so every page is addressable under
 *   `/<slug>/<category>/<repo>/` as well as at its own path, and the pages read the scope rather
 *   than those route params.
 * - `provideQitsBuilds` puts the pending-builds bolt beside that picker: a popover of what qits-ci
 *   is building right now, from `GET /ci/api/runs/active`. Same-origin like every other read here —
 *   the edge routes `/ci` on every host — so it needs the `provideHttpClient` above and names no
 *   origin of its own. Providing it is what puts the bolt there, exactly as no project source means
 *   no picker. Closed, it asks nothing at all; it polls only while a reader keeps the panel open.
